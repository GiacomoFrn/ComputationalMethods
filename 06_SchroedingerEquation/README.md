# Schroedinger Equation

Code developed to solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation using the _Crank Nicolson_ algorithm. 
Boundary conditions: the wavefunctions has to be 0 at the borders. 

Intial wavefunction : <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi (x, t_0) = e^{iqx} e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}"> to be normalized

Potential barrier of height _V0_ in the range [a, b].
