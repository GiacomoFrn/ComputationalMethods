# Pendulum

Consider the single pendulum motion equation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{d^2 \theta(t)}{dt^2} = -\frac{g}{l} \sin (\theta(t))">
Solve the differential equation using _Runge Kutta_ and initial angles in the range [0,90]. 

Then compute the ratio between the computed period and the ideal one.
